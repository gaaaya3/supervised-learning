1. Feature scaling is necessary for algorithms like SVM and k-NN, which are sensitive to the scale of the input features.


2.  Classification Algorithm Implementation
    1.Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification that predicts probabilities using a logistic function.
Suitable for this dataset as it provides interpretable coefficients.
   2. Decision Tree Classifier:
A Decision Tree Classifier splits the data into branches to make predictions based on feature values.
Itâ€™s suitable due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships.
     3.Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.
Good for this dataset due to its robustness against noise.
     4. Support Vector Machine (SVM):
SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in high-dimensional space.
Suitable for this dataset as it can handle complex boundaries.
     5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):
A non-parametric method that classifies based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.
Suitable for this dataset due to its simplicity and effectiveness with well-scaled data.


3.Results Interpretation
The model with the highest accuracy is considered the best performer.
The model with the lowest accuracy is considered the worst performer.
